                                <p>Shadow Rise is a Cooperative Multiplayer game in which players are assigned to 2 teams, Cops and Criminals.
                                    The map is a relatively tall structure that focuses on platforming from one platform to the other until the criminals reach a helicopter at the top. 
                                    The cops have guns which have a long reload time to prevent spamming and the cops must kill the criminals before reaching the top of the structure. 
                                    There will also be interactable environments such as weaker platforms that cops can break so that criminals fall through. </p><br>
                                    <p>
                                    The criminals will have tools that can slow but not kill the cops. There needs to be a minimum of 2 players for the game to run. 
                                    If there is an odd number of people 1 more will be assigned to the criminals. The person who gets onto the leaderboard is only the person who reached the heli. 
                                    The criminals will start a higher level then cops to give a true feeling of a chase.</p>

                                  <p> This was the initial version of the game with just blocks moving around, with no score,health bar and no map design.<br>

                                   <p>  This is the final version of the game with complete game mechanics working and a redesigned map with multiple platforms making the game challenging.</p>
